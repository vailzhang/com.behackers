Installation
Install via Composer
The easiest way to install apai-io is to use the PHP dependency management tool composer.

First you have to add a file named composer.json to your project root

Edit this composer.json and add the following content to it

{
    "require": {
        "exeu/apai-io": "dev-master"
    }
}
Now you have to download composer:

curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
Note that there are other ways to get composer. Please read the guide: http://getcomposer.org/download/

After composer is downloaded you can run the following command:

$ php composer.phar install
After the installation succeeded, composer created a vendor dir where the library is placed and a additional autoload.php which you can include.

For example - create a index.php and add the following:

require_once "vendor/autoload.php";

use ApaiIO\Configuration\GenericConfiguration;
use ApaiIO\ApaiIO;

$conf
    ->setCountry('com')
    ->setAccessKey('YOUR ACCESS KEY')
    ->setSecretKey('YOUR SECRET KEY')
    ->setAssociateTag('YOUR ASSOCIATE TAG');

$apaiIo = new ApaiIO($conf);
Now your done and ready to use apai-io. See Basic usage
